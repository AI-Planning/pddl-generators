In the solitaire game "Spider solitaire" stacks of cards of the same suit can be
moved from a pile to another and cards can be placed on a card with a value that
is higher by one (of any suit). In contrast to the real game, all cards are
face-up from the start, to remove uncertainty. Movement of stacks of cards could
be easily modeled with derived predicates but here we use auxiliary 0-cost
actions that update the state.
