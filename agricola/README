Instance generator for the Agricola domain
submitted by Tomas de la Rosa <trosa@inf.uc3m.es>

Description: This domain is loosely based on the board game Agricola. The game models a
farm with some workers. The game has a number of rounds and stages, in which the player
must select actions for every worker. Some of this actions will obtain resources, and
others will increase the number of workers. This allows the player to perform more actions
per turn but also increases the amount of food consumed at the end of the turn,
potentially leading into dead ends.
