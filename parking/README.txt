This domain involves parking cars on a street with N curb locations
where cars can be double parked but not triple parked. The goal is to
move from one configuration of parked cars to another configuration by
driving cars from one curb location to another. The problems in the
competition contain 2*(N-1) cars, which allows one free curb space and
guarantees solvability. The problem difficulty is scaled by increasing
the number of curb locations. This domain is isomorphic to a
bounded-table blocks world domain where there are N table locations and
2*(N-1) blocks and towers are only allowed to contain 2 blocks.
