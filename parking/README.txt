This domain involves parking cars on a street with N curb locations where cars can be
double parked but not triple parked. The goal is to move from one configuration of parked
cars to another configuration by driving cars from one curb location to another. The
problems in the competition contain 2*(N-1) cars, which allows one free curb space and
guarantees solvability. The problem difficulty is scaled by increasing the number of curb
locations. This domain is isomorphic to a bounded-table blocks world domain where there
are N table locations and 2*(N-1) blocks and towers are only allowed to contain 2 blocks.

OPT 11: from 7 to 12 curbs, several instances of the same size
OPT 14: from 7 to 11 curbs, several instances of the same size
