Hiking
======

Author: Lee McCluskey.

Imagine you want to walk with your partner a long clockwise circular
route over several days (e.g. in the "Lake District" in NW England),
and you do one "leg" each day. You want to start at a certain point and
do the walk in one direction, without ever walking backwards. You have
two cars which you must use to carry your tent/luggage and to carry you
and your partner to the start/end of a leg, if necessary. Driving a car
between any two points is allowed, but walking must be done with your
partner and must start from the place where you left off. As you will
be tired when you've walked to the end of a leg, you must have your
tent up ready there so you can sleep the night before you set off to do
the next leg the morning.
