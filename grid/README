One current issue is that locked spots are distributed entirely randomly. It would be more
interesting if we have some kind of "rooms" scenario where is more likely that one must
traverse via some locked places.


usage:

OPTIONS   DESCRIPTIONS

-x <num>    x scale (minimal 1)
-y <num>    y scale (minimal 1)

-t <num>    num different key+lock types (minimal 1)

-k <num>    number keys vector (dezimal)
-l <num>    number locks vector (dezimal)

-p <num>    probability of any key being mentioned in the goal (preset: 100)

-s <num>    random seed (optional)


IPC instances:

-x 5 -y 5 -t 4 -k 8 -l 8 -p ? -s 0
