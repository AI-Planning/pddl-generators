A worker is in a shed, containing a number of spanners, and at a gate some
distance away there are a number of nuts that must be tightened. Crucially, once
the worker has left the shed they cannot return. Also, the spanners are fragile,
so once used to tighten a nut they break, and then cannot be used to tighten
another. The goal is planning to pick-up the spanners and tighten the nuts. This
is an interesting domain for learning, as it has a directed search space, and is
challenging for planners employing an 'ignore delete lists' relaxation.
