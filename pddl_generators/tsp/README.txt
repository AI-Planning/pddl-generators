## TSP

*   Origin: Obtained from Maria Fox and Derek Long.
*   Adaptions: None.
*   Description: Untyped STRIPS domain. Extremely simple version of TSP.
    The locations are connected by a complete graph, i.e. each location is
    accessible from each other location. The edges all have equal cost -
    one moving operation - and the goal is simply to have all locations
    visited. An optimal solution simply visits all locations once in an
    arbitrary ordering.
*   Parameters: -n number of locations
*   Generation: No randomization.
