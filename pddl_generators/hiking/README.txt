Hiking
======

Author: Lee McCluskey.

Imagine you want to walk with your partner a long clockwise circular route over several
days (e.g. in the "Lake District" in NW England), and you do one "leg" each day. You want
to start at a certain point and do the walk in one direction, without ever walking
backwards. You have two cars which you must use to carry your tent/luggage and to carry
you and your partner to the start/end of a leg, if necessary. Driving a car between any
two points is allowed, but walking must be done with your partner and must start from the
place where you left off. As you will be tired when you've walked to the end of a leg, you
must have your tent up ready there so you can sleep the night before you set off to do the
next leg the morning.
