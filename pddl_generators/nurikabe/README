This is a version of the Floortile domain where a robot must paint a certain pattern in a
grid and cannot move into locations that have already been painted. The pattern is not
decided in advance, but instead it must fulfill the constraints of a simplified Nurikabe
puzzle. The grid has some positions marked with a number. When the robot is on top of a
cell with a number N on it, it can start the paint action so that the next N cells
(including the current position) will be painted. There is an additional constraint that
two adjacent cells cannot belong to cells of different groups.
