Sokoban Domain:
---------------
(Learning Track of the Sixth International Planning Competition, 2008)

This domain is inspired by the popular Sokoban puzzle game where an
agent has the goal of pushing a set of boxes into specified goal
locations in a grid with walls.

The competition problems are generated in a way that guarantees
solvability.
