usage: generator.py [-h] [--density DENSITY] [--seed SEED] rows columns cars garages

positional arguments:
  rows               the number of grid rows.
  columns            the number of grid columns.
  cars               how many cars have to go through the network
  garages            the number of starting garages

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --density DENSITY  The ratio of the available roads in the road network
                     (0.0 <= density <= 1.0). Junctions are randomly set
                     obstructed/unavailable for passage
  --seed SEED        random seed


This model aims to simulate the impact of road building / demolition on
traffic flows. A city is represented as an acyclic graph, in which each
node is a junction and edges are "potential" roads. Some cars start from
different positions and have to reach their final destination as soon as
possible. The agent has a finite number of roads available, which can be
built for connecting two junctions and allowing a car to move between
them. Roads can also be removed, and placed somewhere else, if needed.
In order to place roads or to move cars, the destination junction must
be clear, i.e., no cars should be in there.



pddl-generator note:

See README.old for the usage of the original code by Mauro.

In the original version, sparsity was a 0 / 1 flag which,
when enabled, 20% of the roads become unavailable.

In this version, we can specify the sparsity as a probability (default: 1.0).
To achieve the same sparsity as the original, give 0.8 as a --density parameter.
