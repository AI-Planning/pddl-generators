## CITYCAR DOMAIN GENERATOR.
## IPC 2014
## author: Mauro Vallati -- University of Huddersfield

usage: generator.py <rows> <columns> <n_cars> <n_garage> <sparse> <random_seed>
     row and columns indicate the grid size. They should be > 1
     n_cars indicates how many cars have to go through the network
     n_garage indicates the number of starting garages
     sparse is used for designing networks with 'holes', i.e. junctions that cannot be used
     random_seed allows for control of the generator randomization. Optional, and should be >= 1.

This model aims to simulate the impact of road building / demolition on
traffic flows. A city is represented as an acyclic graph, in which each
node is a junction and edges are "potential" roads. Some cars start from
different positions and have to reach their final destination as soon as
possible. The agent has a finite number of roads available, which can be
built for connecting two junctions and allowing a car to move between
them. Roads can also be removed, and placed somewhere else, if needed.
In order to place roads or to move cars, the destination junction must
be clear, i.e., no cars should be in there.



pddl-generator note:

Sparsity was a 0 / 1 flag in the original version.
When it is enabled, 20% of the roads become unavailable.

In this version, we can specify the sparsity as a probability (default: 1.0).
To achieve the same sparsity as the original, give 0.8 as a parameter.
