IPC Instances

In the IPC there were two separate sets. All instances have 4 suits, 

SET1:
4 suits, 3 to 13 cards per suite, from 4 to 8 columns

SET2: Scales cards from 2 to 13, 4 instances per size.




It makes sense to make cards the main parameter. Scale number of columns at the same time as the number of cards.
