Settlers:
submitted by Marcel Steinmetz <steinmetz@cs.uni-saarland.de>

Settlers was a numeric domain originally developed by Patrik Haslum and included in IPC
2002. This is a variant where numeric resources are discretized and numeric effects are
encoded using quantified conditional effects. Moreover, this is a resource-constrained
version where amount of available resources is decided taking into account the minimal
amount of resources needed to solve the instance.

Description of the original domain: This one was for the numeric track and proved to be a
very tough resource management domain. Several interesting issues in encoding arise as
well as the subsequent problem of planning with the domain. In particular, resources can
be combined to construct vehicles of various kinds. Since these vehicles are not available
initially, this is an example of a problem in which new objects are created. PDDL does not
conveniently support this concept at present, so it is necessary to name "potential"
vehicles at the outset, which can be realised through construction. A very high degree of
redundant symmetry exists between these "potential" vehicles, since it does not matter
which vehicle names are actually used for the vehicles that are realised in a
plan. Planners that begin by grounding all actions can be swamped by the large numbers of
potential actions involving these potential vehicles, which could be realised as one of
several different types of actual vehicles.

Plan quality is judged by a linear combination of labour use, pollution creation and
resource consumption. There is scope for constructing very hard metrics that involve
maximising housing construction subject to an increasing pollution penalty (say), to
ensure that optimal plan quality is bounded.
